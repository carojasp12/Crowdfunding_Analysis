# Crowdfunding_Analysis
Organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends


1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

-	The three campaigns that have the most successful outcomes are the most popular ones: film & video, music, and theater.
-	Campaigns have a better chance of a successful outcome during the summertime.
-	Campaigns with goals that were set between 1,500 and 3,999 have a better chance of a successful outcome. 

2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
   
-	We do not have information of the income, age, or sex of the donors. With that information we can infer better conclusions about what audience to target depending on the kind of camping want to run.
-	We should convert all the currencies to only one because each currency has a different value. 

3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
   
-	A graph that shows the distribution of the campaignâ€™s successful and failed outcomes.
-	A graph that shows how the country can affect the goal in that way we can see what goal is better depending on the location of the campaign. 

Statistical Analysis

1.	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
   
- The mean better summarize the data because the distribution is uniform and has a small number of outliers.

2.	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
   
- There is more variability with successful campaigns because the data set is bigger and with a higher maximum.
